# Eyesight Test App

A mobile-friendly web application designed to test short-sightedness by displaying characters of decreasing size.

## Features

- Displays random letters and numbers that get smaller over time
- Mobile-optimized for testing at arm's length
- Tracks how many characters you can identify before they become unreadable
- Stores results with date and time in a scoreboard
- No installation required - works in any modern browser

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your mobile browser (or use a web server to host the files)
2. Hold your phone at arm's length
3. Press "Next Character" when you can identify the displayed character
4. Click "I Can't See" when the character becomes too small to identify
5. View your results and track your progress over time

## How It Works

- Each time you click "Next Character," the font size decreases
- The app records how many characters you could identify before they became unreadable
- Results are stored in your browser's local storage
- The scoreboard tracks your progress over time to monitor eye health

## Tips for Accurate Testing

- Always hold your device at the same distance (arm's length) 
- Test in consistent lighting conditions
- Test at similar times of day for the most accurate tracking
- If possible, remove glasses/contacts when testing to track your true eyesight changes
